	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.
